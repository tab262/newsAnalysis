Will need need the twitter OAuth codes.

First thing to do is to create a text file in the following format

access_token_key 
access_token_secret
consumer_key
consumer_secret 

But with JUST the actual codes. 

Then go to Twitter_Sent.py and note Line 3. Replace the string with the proper filepath of the above textfile.


After this, try and run search/main.py. 

You're probably going to get a bunch of missing module errors. Nothing to do, but install em. I recommoned getting pythons pip module first, which once installed allows you to do things like

sudo pip install <package>


Note once it is up and running, the times posted are GMT, so subtract 4 hours
