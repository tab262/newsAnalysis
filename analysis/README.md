newsAnalysis
============

Collection of scripts that scrape and analyze news articles

articleAnalysis.py contains the meat of the code, while rules is some random nlp stuff I'm still working on and isn't really documented.

article1 and article2 are individual articles, while megeArticle is a collection of 6-8 articles just pasted in with plaintext.
